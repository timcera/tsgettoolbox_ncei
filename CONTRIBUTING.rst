Get Started!
------------
Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `tsgettoolbox_ncei` for local development.

1. Fork the `tsgettoolbox_ncei` repo at
   https://github.com/timcera/tsgettoolbox_ncei

2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_github_login/tsgettoolbox_ncei.git

3. Create a virtual python environment with `pip` or `conda` (whatever you
   prefer) and activate it, and install `tsgettoolbox_ncei` in development
   mode::

    #     Using conda would be something like this:
    $ conda create -n tsgettoolbox_ncei python=3.11
    $ conda activate tsgettoolbox_ncei
    $ cd tsgettoolbox_ncei/

    #     The following command will list all the dependencies that will be
    #     installed, but not actually install them.
    $ python -m pip install --dry-run -e .

    #     Use conda to install the dependencies listed above, excluding
    #     tsgettoolbox_ncei itself. For example:
    $ conda install -c conda-forge numpy pandas

    #     Now install tsgettoolbox_ncei in development mode.
    $ python -m pip install -e .

4. For linting, reformatting, and testing you also need to install ruff and
   pytest::

    $ conda install -c conda-forge ruff pytest

5. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

    Now you can make your changes locally.

6. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass pytest, the
   ruff linter and ruff formatter.::

    $ ruff check -f --select "I" .
    $ ruff format .
    $ pytest

7. Commit your changes and push your branch to github::

    $ git add .  # or choose the specific files you want to add
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

8. Submit a pull request through the github website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.10 and above.
